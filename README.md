# SPACE TIME

### Story

Space Time is a short platformer game created by an unknown programmer on a very ancient computer. Since the amount of space on the computer is too low to incorporate the entire game, the developer originally decided to decrease the viewing space of the player as time progresses. The developer wrote it on his game design document that the machine had too little space to render the entire screen for the entire gameplay duration. Don’t worry! you can still collect few gold coins to increase the viewing space of the player. And oh: According to another point mentioned under the “How I optimised this game” section: Looks like some of the grounds are also programmed to break after the player stands too long to make sure too many block elements are not stored in the computer’s memory at a given time. Can you still use these constrains to help the poor player reach the castle?
